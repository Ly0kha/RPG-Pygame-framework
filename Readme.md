# MORE INFO
This is a basic  game written in Python using the Pygame library. The framework includes the following components:

1. Initialization: This section imports the necessary libraries and initializes Pygame.

2. Screen and caption: This section sets the screen size and caption of the game window.

3.Player, enemy, and item: This section loads the player, enemy, and item images and sets their initial positions on the screen.

4.Level: This section sets the initial level of the game.

5.Game loop: This section contains the main game loop that runs until the player exits the game. Inside the loop, the game handles events, such as player input, and updates the game state.

6.Movement: This section contains the logic for moving the player and enemy on the screen.

7.Collision detection: This section checks for collisions between the player and the item and performs the corresponding action (e.g. player collects item).

8.Drawing: This section draws the player, enemy, and item on the screen and updates the level bar.

9.Display update: This section updates the game display.

10.Quit: This section quits Pygame when the game is over.

Overall, this framework provides the basic structure for a 2D game and can be expanded upon to add more features and functionality.
